# Microsoft's Phi-3 family

The Phi-3 models are the most capable and cost-effective Small Language Models(SLMs) available, outperforming models of the same size and the next size up across a variety of language, reasoning, coding, and math benchmarks. This release expands the selection of high-quality models for customers, offering more practical choices for composing and building generative AI applications.

The Phi-3 Family includes mini, small, medium and vision versions, trained based on different parameter amounts to serve various application scenarios. Each model is instruction-tuned and developed in accordance with Microsoft's Responsible AI, safety and security standards to ensure it's ready to use off-the-shelf. Phi-3-mini outperforms models twice its size, and Phi-3-small and Phi-3-medium outperform much larger models, including GPT-3.5T.

## Phi-3-mini

Phi-3-mini, a 3.8B parameter language model, is available on [Microsoft Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models?selectedCollection=phi), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-3-6626e15e9585a200d2d761e3), and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library/phi3). It offers two context lengths: [128K](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct/version/9/registry/azureml) and [4K](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct/version/9/registry/azureml).

Phi-3-mini is a Transformer-based language model with 3.8 billion parameters. It was trained using high-quality data containing educationally useful information, augmented with new data sources consisting of various NLP synthetic texts, and both internal and external chat datasets, which significantly improve chat capabilities. Additionally, Phi-3-mini has been chat fine-tuned after pre-training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Following this post-training, Phi-3-mini has demonstrated significant improvements in several capabilities, particularly in alignment, robustness, and safety. The model is part of the Phi-3 family and comes in the mini version with two variants, 4K and 128K, which represent the context length (in tokens) that it can support.

## Phi-3.5-mini-instruct 

[Phi-3.5 mini](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct/version/1/registry/azureml) is a lightweight, state-of-the-art open model built upon datasets used for Phi-3 - synthetic data and filtered publicly available websites - with a focus on very high-quality, reasoning dense data. The model belongs to the Phi-3 model family and supports 128K token context length. The model underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures.

Phi-3.5 Mini has 3.8B parameters and is a dense decoder-only Transformer model using the same tokenizer as Phi-3 Mini.

Overall, the model with only 3.8B-param achieves a similar level of multilingual language understanding and reasoning ability as much larger models. However, it is still fundamentally limited by its size for certain tasks. The model simply does not have the capacity to store too much factual knowledge, therefore, users may experience factual incorrectness. However, we believe such weakness can be resolved by augmenting Phi-3.5 with a search engine, particularly when using the model under RAG settings.

### Language Support 

The table below highlights multilingual capability of the Phi-3 on multilingual MMLU, MEGA, and multilingual MMLU-pro datasets. Overall, we observed that even with just 3.8B active parameters, the model is very competitive on multilingual tasks in comparison to other models with a much bigger active parameters.

[!NOTE]
We recommend switching to Phi-3.5-MoE as an upgrade of Phi-3-medium as the MoE model is a much better and cost effective model.

## Phi-3-vision

The [Phi-3-vision](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct/version/2/registry/azureml), a 4.2B parameter multimodal model with language and vision capabilities, outperforms larger models like Claude-3 Haiku and Gemini 1.0 Pro V in general visual reasoning, OCR, and table and chart understanding tasks.

Phi-3-vision is the first multimodal model in the Phi-3 family, bringing together text and images. Phi-3-vision can be used to reason over real-world images and extract and reason over text from images. It has also been optimized for chart and diagram understanding and can be used to generate insights and answer questions. Phi-3-vision builds on the language capabilities of the Phi-3-mini, continuing to pack strong language and image reasoning quality in a small size.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Phi-3 models do not perform as well on factual knowledge benchmarks (such as TriviaQA) as the smaller model size results in less capacity to retain facts.

## Phi silica

We are introducing Phi Silica which is built from the Phi series of models and is designed specifically for the NPUs in Copilot+ PCs. Windows is the first platform to have a state-of-the-art small language model (SLM) custom built for the NPU and shipping inbox. Phi Silica API along with OCR, Studio Effects, Live Captions, and Recall User Activity APIs will be available in Windows Copilot Library in June. More APIs like Vector Embedding, RAG API, and Text Summarization will be coming later.

## ONNX Models

The primary difference between the two ONNX models, “cpu-int4-rtn-block-32” and “cpu-int4-rtn-block-32-acc-level-4”, is the accuracy level. The model with “acc-level-4” is designed to balance latency versus accuracy, with a minor trade-off in accuracy for better performance, which might be particularly suitable for mobile devices
