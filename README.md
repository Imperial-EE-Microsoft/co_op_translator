## Setting up the Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment for development:

1. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source venv/bin/activate`.
2. Install the packages by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Fill in the environment variables an `.env` file, filling in the provided `.env.template` as a guide.

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you work on the project by running `source env/bin/activate` from the repository's root directory.
